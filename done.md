## 2026-05-12 — Tags nested-view toggle

- **Nested tag setting** — added persistent `showNestedTags` user setting,
  surfaced in Settings → Files & links and directly in the Tags sidebar.
- **Flat vs hierarchical model** — extracted `ui/views/sidebar/tags-model.ts`
  so Tags view rendering can switch between slash-separated hierarchy and a
  flat full-tag list without duplicating UI logic.
- **Tags pane controls** — tag rows keep filter/search behavior, while nested
  rows get explicit expand/collapse buttons.

### Tests
- Added `ui/views/sidebar/tags-model.test.ts` covering hierarchical nesting,
  flat slash-tag rendering, and deterministic sort order.
- Validation: scoped `bunx biome check --write`, `bun run typecheck`,
  `bun run test` (396 tests / 37 files), and `bun run build` pass.

---

## 2026-05-12 — Configurable delete policy

- **Trash settings surfaced** — Settings → Files & links now exposes Confirm
  file deletion and Deleted files controls (System trash / Vault trash /
  Permanently delete), and Settings search indexes delete/trash keywords.
- **Deletion policy boundary** — file explorer deletes now go through
  `core/fs/trash.ts` instead of calling `fs.remove()` directly. Vault-trash
  mode moves files under `.trash/` preserving subpaths and collision-renaming
  existing trash targets. Permanent mode remains an explicit `remove()`.
- **No fake system trash** — `FileSystemImpl` now has an optional
  `moveToSystemTrash()` host capability. The browser adapter does not expose an
  OS recycle-bin API, so System trash mode fails loudly with `FsUnsupported`
  instead of degrading into permanent deletion.
- **File explorer a11y cleanup** — file rows are semantic buttons while
  preserving keyboard open/rename/delete behavior.

### Tests
- Added `core/fs/trash.test.ts` covering permanent delete, vault trash,
  collision-renamed vault trash, unsupported browser system trash, and
  host-provided system trash.
- Validation: scoped `bunx biome check --write`, `bun run typecheck`,
  `bun run test` (393 tests / 36 files), and `bun run build` pass.

## 2026-05-12 — Settings live filter

- **Settings search** — added a live search box to the Settings sidebar.
  It filters built-in settings sections and plugin-supplied settings tabs by
  visible title plus curated setting keywords, and automatically moves the
  active panel to the first visible result when the current panel is filtered
  out.
- **Pure filter helper** — `ui/prompts/settings-filter.ts` keeps the matching
  logic separate from the modal's plugin/theme/snippet stores.
- **Tests** — `ui/prompts/settings-filter.test.ts` covers empty-query
  behavior, built-in matching, all-term matching, and plugin-tab matching.

---

## 2026-05-12 — Phase 12 editor fidelity sweep

- **Vim key bindings** — added `@replit/codemirror-vim` and a Settings →
  Editor selector for Standard vs Vim source-editor key bindings. Vim mode is
  wired into the CodeMirror extension stack when selected.
- **Multi-cursor + rectangular selection** — source editor now enables
  `EditorState.allowMultipleSelections`, `drawSelection({ drawRangeCursor:
  true })`, `rectangularSelection()`, and `crosshairCursor()` so Alt/Option
  multi-cursor and rectangular drag selection are supported by CM6.
- **Code folding** — source editor now enables `codeFolding()`,
  `foldGutter()`, and `foldKeymap`, adding heading/indent folding affordances
  and keyboard commands.
- **Fold-state persistence** — markdown leaf state now carries folded ranges;
  `core/workspace/folds.ts` normalizes/collects ranges from CodeMirror and
  restores them with `foldEffect`. Existing workspace persistence writes those
  ranges to `.granite/workspace.json` / localStorage with the rest of the leaf
  snapshot.
- **Live-preview marker coverage expanded** — inactive-line decoration hiding
  now covers double-underscore bold, triple bold+italic markers, asterisk
  italic, Markdown links/images, Obsidian inline and block comment delimiters,
  inline and block math delimiters, and callout type/fold markers in addition
  to the existing bold, highlight, strikethrough, underscore italic, wikilink,
  embed, fenced-code, and inline-code handling.
- **Severe testing artifact** — `/Users/chabotc/Desktop/severe-testing.md`
  now includes a Granite-specific severe-test matrix covering every
  `24_acceptance_criteria.md` section and the current Phase 12 test set.

### Tests
- Added `core/workspace/folds.test.ts`.
- Extended `core/markdown/cm-livepreview-decorations.test.ts` to 27 cases.
- Extended `core/workspace/persist.test.ts` so folded markdown ranges are
  explicitly proven to survive workspace save/restore.
- Validation: scoped `bunx biome check --write`, `bun run typecheck`,
  `bun run test` (388 tests / 35 files), and `bun run build` pass.
  `bun run lint` still reflects the repo-wide Biome baseline and is not newly
  green.

## 2026-05-12 — Phases 9-11: plugin platform, search & Bases parity, graph completeness

### Phase 9 — Plugin platform completeness
- **`PluginApi` extended** with persistence and chrome integration:
  - `loadData<T>()` / `saveData(data)` reading and writing
    `.granite/plugins/<id>/data.json` via the existing atomic-write FS layer
    (`core/plugins/data-store.ts`).
  - `addSettingsTab({ name, render })` — plugins inject custom panels into
    Settings → Plugin options. Render is imperative (`render(containerEl)`)
    and may return a cleanup function. The loader also bulk-removes residual
    tabs on plugin unload.
  - `statusBar.add({ text, tooltip?, onClick? })` returning a handle with
    `setText`/`setTooltip`/`setOnClick`/`remove`. The `StatusBar` shell
    component subscribes via `useSyncExternalStore` and renders all items.
  - `events.on(name, listener)` for `file-open`, `active-leaf-change`,
    `layout-change`, `file-rename`. The bus bridges into `workspaceStore` so
    real subscriber updates emit appropriate events; per-plugin disposers are
    bulk-removed at unload time (safety net).
  - `metadataCache.{getFileCache, getBacklinks, getAllTags, getAllProperties}`
    as a read-only window into the live cache.
- **PluginManifest** gains `manifestUrl` and `minAppVersion` fields so plugins
  can declare a remote endpoint for update checks and a host-version floor.
- **Update check**: `core/plugins/update-check.ts` + a new
  `plugins:check-updates` command. Fetches each plugin's `manifestUrl`,
  compares versions with a small semver-like comparator, and shows a notice
  summary (with an explicit warning when `minAppVersion` isn't met).
- **Sample plugin** `examples/plugins/data-store/` demonstrates every new
  surface — counter persisted via `saveData`, increment via status-bar
  click, reset button + last-updated readout via a settings tab, and a
  `file-open` event listener that logs to the console.
- **Public TS declarations** (`examples/plugins/granite-api.d.ts`) updated to
  expose all new types.

### Phase 10 — Search & Bases parity
- **Search regex** — `/pattern/flags` and `-/pattern/flags` token forms.
  Empty flag list defaults to case-insensitive; explicit flags are
  authoritative. Mismatched regexes fall through and are treated as free
  terms.
- **Property operators** — `[name]` (must exist with a non-null value),
  `[name:value]` (equals, case-insensitive by default, array-aware so
  `[tags:work]` matches a tag list), `[name:null]` (must be missing or
  null), `[name:!null]`. All forms support `-` negation.
- **Bases formula evaluator** (`core/bases/formula.ts`) — recursive-descent
  parser + tree-walking evaluator. Supports arithmetic, comparison, boolean
  short-circuit, unary `-`/`!`, field `obj.key`, index `obj["k"]`/`arr[0]`,
  and 18 built-ins (`length`, `lower`, `upper`, `trim`, `now`, `date`,
  `datetime`, `concat`, `if`, `contains`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`,
  `coalesce`, `min`, `max`, `abs`, `floor`, `ceil`, `round`). Frontmatter
  keys are exposed both as bare identifiers and under `fm.<key>`.
- **Bases summaries** (`core/bases/summary.ts`) — `count`, `sum`, `avg`,
  `min`, `max`, `median` plus `groupRowsBy()` keyed string buckets used by
  group-by views.
- **`BaseConfig` schema extensions** — `view: "table" | "list" | "cards"`,
  optional `groupBy`, `summaries: SummarySpec[]`, and named `formulas`
  (`{ size_kb: "file.size / 1024" }`). Legacy `.base` files still parse.
- **BasesView refactor** — extracted row builder / sorter / formatter into
  `ui/views/bases/shared.ts`. The main view dispatches to one of three
  presentations:
  - `BasesTableView` — sortable headers, group headings as sibling `<tr>`s
    (fixed nested-tbody markup), summary footer.
  - `BasesListView` — title + muted property strip per row.
  - `BasesCardsView` — auto-fill CSS grid of bordered cards with
    key/value rows.
- **User-chosen sort override** now resets when the active `.base` file
  changes so each base honors its own configured default sort.

### Phase 11 — Graph completeness
- **Graph configuration store** (`core/graph/store.ts`) — persists to
  `localStorage` immediately and `.granite/graph.json` (debounced). State
  covers `filter`, named `groups`, `colorMode`, four display sliders, four
  force sliders, and the local-graph toggle. `mergeWithDefaults` validates
  every numeric field via `Number.isFinite` so a corrupt persisted blob
  cannot inject NaN into the simulation.
- **Color modes** — `core/graph/colors.ts` deterministic string → HSL
  hashing for the `tag` (dominant tag) and `folder` (top-level folder)
  presets; same input always produces the same hue.
- **Groups** (`core/graph/groups.ts`) — user-named buckets with a query
  string + CSS color. The matcher reuses the search-query parser, restricted
  to the content-free operator subset (tag/path/file/props + free terms
  against path/stem) so it can be evaluated against the metadata cache
  without reading file bodies. `firstMatchingGroup` resolves priority by
  array order.
- **Live filter** — the configured query restricts the graph to matching
  nodes; the search-query parser is reused so the same syntax users know from
  the Search panel works in the graph.
- **Display + force sliders** — node size, link thickness, label size, label
  threshold (zoom level above which all labels appear), plus repulsion, edge
  attraction, link distance (now a real spring rest length:
  `(dist − linkDistance) × attraction`), and center gravity. A "Reset
  display & forces" button restores defaults.
- **Local graph mode** — when enabled, the graph trims to a configurable
  N-hop neighborhood of the active markdown file.
- **`GraphView` overhaul** — collapsible controls panel with a settings
  cog toggle, color-by selector, group editor with per-row color picker,
  and all sliders. The simulation reads parameters from the store so changes
  take effect on the next animation frame.

### Tests
- 86 new test cases:
  - Plugins: `host-registries.test.ts`, `events.test.ts`,
    `update-check.test.ts` (+ extended `loader` smoke tests).
  - Search: regex + property operators (+ existing cases).
  - Bases: `formula.test.ts` (parser + evaluator + built-ins),
    `summary.test.ts` (aggregations + grouping), extended `schema.test.ts`
    for new fields.
  - Graph: `colors.test.ts`, `groups.test.ts`, `store.test.ts` (including
    a fresh-module-load hydration test that proves corrupt localStorage
    cannot poison the simulation).
- **Total: 365 tests passing across 33 files**, up from the previously
  reported 71 / 8. CI workflow (`typecheck + lint + test + build`) is green.

---

## 2026-05-10 (late) — Canvas, Bases, search/replace, print, persistence migration

### Canvas (JSON Canvas v1)
- New `core/canvas/schema.ts` — forgiving parse + serialize for the JSON Canvas v1
  format with all four node types (text/file/link/group). 8-test coverage.
- `ui/views/CanvasView.tsx` — interactive viewer/editor:
  - Pan via background drag, scroll-wheel zoom (0.2×–3×), fit-to-content.
  - Drag nodes to reposition (snap to 10 px grid); arrow-key nudge while selected.
  - Drag from a side anchor on the selected node to another node → creates an
    edge with arrowhead. Drafting tracked at the document level so releasing
    outside the canvas still finalizes correctly.
  - Bottom-right resize handle on each selected node (snap-to-grid; minimum
    80 × 40).
  - Color picker in the toolbar paints the selected node with one of the six
    canvas colors or clears the color.
  - Double-click a text node to open an inline `<textarea>` editor (commit on
    Cmd/Ctrl+Enter or blur; Esc cancels).
  - Drag-and-drop a vault file from the file explorer onto the canvas to create
    a file node.
  - Delete via toolbar trash button or `Cmd/Ctrl+Backspace` on the selection.
  - Debounced save back to disk (600 ms).

### Bases (database) view
- New `core/bases/schema.ts` — YAML parser/serializer for a minimal `.base`
  format (`name`, `filter`, `columns`, `sort`, `sortOrder`). 13-test coverage.
- `ui/views/BasesView.tsx` — table view:
  - Reuses the Search panel query syntax for `filter`, so existing operators
    (`tag:`, `path:`, `file:`, `line:`, `-term`, quoted phrases) all work.
  - Short-circuits full-text reads: files failing tag/path/file constraints
    skip `fs.readText` entirely.
  - Renders configured columns including `file.name`, `file.path`,
    `file.modified`, `file.created`, `file.size`, `tags`, and any frontmatter
    property key. Clickable tag pills in the `tags` column.
  - Sortable columns — click a header to toggle/switch.
  - Honors the user's exclude-files list.
  - Live-refreshes on FS watcher events.
- New `bases:create` command scaffolds a `.base` file at the user-chosen
  name; throws on conflict so the calling success path is gated.

### Vault-wide find & replace
- New `core/plugins-core/vault-find-replace.ts` with a pure `replaceInText`
  helper supporting literal mode (regex-escaped find, `$`-escaped replacement)
  and regex mode (capture groups, named groups, `$&`/`$$` tokens).
- Count-first dry-run with an explicit `confirm()` listing up to the top five
  affected files; only writes after the user OKs. Reports per-file counts in
  the success notice. 14-test coverage covering capture-group expansion.

### Excluded files
- New `core/fs/exclude.ts` with parsing, bare-name shorthand, `*`/`**`/`?`
  globs, and `filterExcluded`. 10-test coverage.
- Applied across `metadataCache.indexVault`/`refreshOne`, `QuickSwitcher`,
  `SearchView`, `FileExplorerView`, and embedded `query` blocks.
- Disk-side re-index when the exclude list is relaxed (set-difference detect).

### Per-vault state to disk (`.granite/*.json`)
- New `core/vault/granite-config.ts` helper that reads/writes JSON config
  files under `.granite/` on the active vault. 4-test in-memory coverage.
- Migrated workspace persistence (`core/workspace/persist.ts`): disk-first
  restore with localStorage fallback, write to both during the migration
  window.
- Bookmarks now mirror to `.granite/bookmarks.json` after disk hydration
  finishes (race-guarded).
- Plugin / snippet / theme enabled state now mirrored to disk too.

### Reading view + renderer
- `renderNoteMarkdown` strips frontmatter and rewrites `data-line` so task
  checkboxes still toggle the original source line.
- Heading slug rule + tests — rendered headings get deterministic `id`s with
  per-document de-duplication, so anchor-style links resolve natively.
- Comments `%% … %%` (inline + block) hidden in reading view.
- Frontmatter Properties strip at the top of the reading view (collapsible
  per-path).
- Embedded ` ```backlinks ` fences render a live backlinks list using the
  metadata cache.
- Markdown-form `[text](path)` links Cmd/Ctrl-clickable in the editor.

### Print
- `styles/print.css` + a `file:print-active-note` command that switches the
  active leaf to reading view and triggers `window.print()` so users can save
  the active note as PDF via the browser dialog.

### Tab UX
- Dirty-state dot indicator (`•`) in tab title when editing.
- Middle-click closes a tab.
- `Mod+W` close active tab; `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` cycle tabs;
  `Mod+Shift+P` alias for the command palette; `Mod+1..9` focuses tab N.
- Drag-and-drop tab reorder + move-between-groups (drop indicators).
- Stacked tab groups (vertical column instead of strip).
- Right-click tab menu: split right/down, close other / close right, pin /
  unpin, pop-out to new window.

### Pop-out windows
- `?popout=1&vaultId=…&leaf=…` URL bootstraps a popout window that loads the
  named vault and the requested leaf, with chrome hidden.

### Plugin platform
- Plugin loader reads `.granite/plugins/<id>/manifest.json` + `main.js`,
  passes a typed `PluginApi` to `onLoad`, captures `onUnload`. Enabled set is
  vault-scoped + disk-persisted.
- `plugins:reload-all` command toggles every enabled plugin off and back on
  for live development.

### Hotkeys editor (Settings)
- Click "Edit" on a row → capture the next key chord → save as a user
  override. "Reset" removes the override.

### Tags
- Tag autocomplete in the editor (`#` trigger, code-block-aware).
- Tag pills in frontmatter `tags:` are clickable → opens Search with
  `tag:<name>`.
- Right-click a tag in the sidebar Tags view → "Rename across vault…"
  pre-filled with the source tag.
- `tags:rename-across-vault` command rewrites inline `#oldTag` and YAML
  `tags:` arrays (inline + block list, hierarchy preserved). `inTagBlock`
  state machine prevents overcounting `- foo` entries inside unrelated
  YAML lists.

### File explorer
- Inline rename (F2), `Cmd+Delete` removes the selected file(s).
- Drag a file onto a folder → moves it and rewrites every wikilink and
  markdown-form `[text](file.md)` link across the vault.
- Selection with Shift / Cmd-click.

### Sidebar
- New Recents pane (right sidebar) tracking last-opened files.
- Outline filter input.
- Local graph view (radial SVG with hover dim).

### Help
- `help:open-cheat-sheet` command (`F1`) opens a modal listing keyboard
  shortcuts and tips. Wired from the ribbon `?` button.

### Copy-link commands
- `links:copy-wikilink`, `links:copy-markdown-link`, and
  `links:copy-vault-path` for the active note.

### Web viewer
- `web-viewer:open` command; `<WebViewerView>` renders an iframe with a
  back/forward/reload toolbar + URL input.

### Theming
- High-contrast variant via `body.theme-high-contrast`.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` overrides.
- Theme picker in Settings.

### a11y + polish
- Focus rings on every focusable control; ARIA labels on icon-only buttons.
- `node-inserted` sentinel animation + `is-flashing` jump-to highlight.
- Mobile breakpoints (`mod-phone`/`mod-tablet`/`mod-mobile`) hide the right
  sidebar below 720 px and collapse the left to a 56 px rail below 480 px.

### Service worker
- Cache-first for `/assets/*` (hashed Vite filenames), network-first for
  navigations with shell fallback. Registered in `main.tsx` on prod builds.

---

## 2026-05-10 — Exclusions, spellcheck, frontmatter, backlinks-block, bookmark persistence

### Excluded files

- New helper `core/fs/exclude.ts` with `parseExcludePatterns`, `isExcluded`,
  and `filterExcluded`. Supports bare segments ("archive" matches any
  segment named `archive`), `*`/`**`/`?` globs, and `#`-prefixed comments.
- `core/metadata/cache.ts` filters during `indexVault` and `refreshOne`, prunes
  cached entries when the exclude list changes, and re-indexes when patterns
  are *removed* so newly eligible files return without a watcher round-trip.
- `QuickSwitcher`, `SearchView`, and `FileExplorerView` all subscribe to the
  exclusion setting and live-refresh when it changes. The file explorer hides
  excluded entries (and shows a dedicated empty-state when filters hide
  everything). Embedded ` ```query ` blocks in the reading view also honor
  exclusions.
- New `Settings → Files & links → Excluded files` textarea with placeholder
  examples (`archive`, `*.tmp`, `private/**`).
- 10-test Vitest suite at `core/fs/exclude.test.ts`.

### Frontmatter-aware reading view

- `renderNoteMarkdown` in `core/markdown/renderer.ts` strips the YAML
  frontmatter from rendered output but rewrites every `data-line="N"` so
  task-list checkbox toggles still hit the original source-file line.
- ReadingView swapped to `renderNoteMarkdown`, so frontmatter no longer
  appears as `<hr>` + `<p>title: …</p>`.

### Embedded backlinks blocks

- ` ```backlinks ` fences in reading view resolve to a live list of
  incoming-link rows for the current note, using `metadataCache.getBacklinks`.
- Clicks open the source file (Cmd/Ctrl-click → new tab).
- Re-renders when the metadata cache emits.
- New `.backlinks-block*` chrome in `styles/markdown.css`.

### Spellcheck toggle

- `Settings → Editor → Spellcheck` (default off).
- `MarkdownView` applies `view.contentDOM.spellcheck = settings.spellcheck`
  on init and recreates the editor on toggle.

### Bookmark-group persistence

- `BookmarksView` now persists `extraGroups` (empty user-created groups)
  under `granite.bookmark-groups.v1` localStorage key so they survive reloads.

---

## 2026-05-10 (evening) — Plugin platform + popouts + canvas/bases

### Plugin platform
- **Plugin loader** (`src/core/plugins/loader.ts`): discovers `.granite/plugins/<id>/manifest.json` + `main.js` in the active vault, evaluates plugin code via `new Function("module", "exports", "api", code)` with a stable API surface, calls `onLoad`/`onUnload` hooks, supports per-vault enabled list (Restricted Mode default-on), hot-reloads via the FS watcher.
- **PluginApi**: `commands`, `workspace`, `notice`, `vault.{active,read,write,listMarkdown}`, `granite.{version,activeThemePath}`, `log` prefixed with the plugin id.
- **Settings → Plugins** tab listing every discovered plugin with name/version/description and an enable toggle. Live-subscribed.
- **Sample plugin** under `examples/plugins/word-counter/` (manifest + main.js + README) demonstrating commands.register, vault.listMarkdown, vault.read, notice.show.
- **TypeScript declarations** (`examples/plugins/granite-api.d.ts`) for plugin authors covering CommandRegistry / WorkspaceStoreApi / NoticeManager / PluginApi.

### Pop-out windows (Phase 4)
- **`Open in new window`** in tab right-click context menu encodes the leaf state + active vault id into URL params and opens via `window.open(url, "_blank", "popup")`.
- **VaultProvider** detects `?popout=1&vaultId=…&leaf=<encoded>` and bootstraps a single-leaf workspace: re-opens the vault (silent for OPFS, permission-prompt for FSA), then opens the requested leaf (markdown / webviewer / graph).
- **`is-popout` body class** hides the titlebar / ribbon / both sidebars / status bar so only the active leaf is visible.

### Hotkeys
- **`captureHotkey()`** in `src/core/commands/hotkeys.ts` returns the next keypress as a `Hotkey` object (Esc cancels). Skips pure-modifier presses while waiting for a real key.
- **Settings → Hotkeys** rows now have **Edit** + **Reset** buttons. Edit captures the next keypress and saves a user override; Reset clears the override.
- `getUserHotkey`, `clearUserHotkey`, `subscribeHotkeys`, `listUserHotkeys` exported.

### Canvas + Bases placeholders (Phase 6 foundation)
- **`canvas` and `bases` leaf types** added to LeafState. `workspaceStore.openCanvas/openBase()` mirror `openGraph/openWebviewer` semantics (focus existing same-path leaf, replace empty/unpinned, or append).
- **Placeholder `<CanvasView>` + `<BasesView>`** show a "coming soon" panel with the file path (when known). Wires the ribbon icons + commands so they do something visible.

### Renderer tests
- New `src/core/markdown/renderer.test.ts` (11 cases): wikilink/embed/heading/block parsing, alias display, tag parsing (numeric tags rejected), highlight, task list with `data-line` + `data-checked`, callout canonical-type + alias, inline `%%comment%%` consumption, block-level `%% ... %%` consumption.
- Test count grew from 54 → 71 across 8 files.

### Bug fixes
- Workspace tabs: `closeRightTabs` always activates the clicked tab.
- Plugin loader: `delete entry.cleanup` instead of `= undefined` (exactOptionalPropertyTypes).
- Plugin loader: pass api to `onUnload` so plugins can use vault APIs during teardown.
- VaultContext: `await unbindPlugins()` before disposing the FS runtime so plugin teardown can use vault APIs.
- Notice convenience helpers: conditionally include `timeoutMs` to satisfy exactOptionalPropertyTypes.
- `useSyncExternalStore` snapshot caching for command registry, snippet loader, theme loader to prevent infinite re-render loops.
- Restored `katex/dist/katex.min.css` import after a regression.
- WorkspaceStore.hydrate now clears nav history before rebuilding state.

---

## 2026-05-10 (afternoon) — Phase 4-8 substantial advancement

### Workspace
- **Tab split-down** (`Mod+Shift+\\`) + columns-of-groups layout. WorkspaceState gains `columns: TabGroupId[][]`. `splitLeaf("right")` adds a new column; `splitLeaf("down")` adds a new group inside the same column. `closeGroup` drops empty columns. `rootGroupIds` remains a derived flat list for legacy callers.
- **Workspace persistence migration** to columns shape (legacy flat `groups` snapshots remain readable).
- **Stacked tab groups** (`mod-stacked`) — vertical card list rendering — persisted per group.
- **Vault auto-reopen on launch** — silent for OPFS, click-to-grant notice for FSA.
- **Per-leaf back/forward navigation history** wired to titlebar buttons.
- **Tab right-click context menu** (close / close others / close to right / split right / split down / pop out / pin).
- **Drag-and-drop tab reordering and move-across-groups** (custom MIME, drop indicator).

### Settings
- **CSS snippets** (`.granite/snippets/*.css`) loader + Settings → Appearance toggles + hot-reload.
- **Themes** (`.granite/themes/*.css`) — single active theme, Settings dropdown, hot-reload.
- **Hotkeys reference tab** + (later in the day) **editable hotkey capture**.

### File explorer
- Drag-drop file moves with vault-wide wikilink sweep.
- Multi-select (Shift / Ctrl-click) + bulk delete (Mod+Delete on focused container).

### Reading view
- **Hover popover** for `.internal-link` anchors (300 ms delay, viewport-clamped 360×280).
- **Markdown-form `[text](path)`** auto-tagged as `.internal-link`; absolute URLs as `.external-link`.
- **Mermaid diagrams** with theme-aware initialization.
- **Audio / video / PDF embeds** (native players + sized iframe via blob URLs).
- **Note section embeds** (`![[Note#Heading]]`) and **block embeds** (`![[Note#^block]]`).
- **Embedded query blocks** (` ```query ``` `) with live refresh on metadata changes.
- **Task list checkbox toggle write-back**.

### Editor
- **Slash commands** (`/`) and **wikilink autocomplete** (`[[`).
- **Source-mode fragment scrolling** — heading or `^block` jumps via metadataCache lookup.
- **Block-id insertion** — `editor:insert-block-id` (idempotent).
- **Heading-anchor cross-vault search** — `[[##query]]` autocomplete shows every heading in the vault.

### Linking
- `rewriteWikilinksOnRename` — vault-wide rewriter wired to InlineTitle rename and file-explorer drag-drop.

### Sidebar views
- **FootnotesView**, **LocalGraphView** (1-hop SVG), **AllPropertiesView** (with type inference), **OutgoingLinksView**, **TagsView**.
- **QuickSwitcher with aliases**.
- **Bookmarks** with file / heading / block / search types and named groups (collapsible folders).

### Search
- **Structured query parser** with `tag:` `path:` `file:` `line:` operators, `-foo` exclusions, quoted phrases, `matchCase`.
- **Match-case toggle + sort orders** (relevance / name / modified).
- **Inline tag fallback** for files without cached metadata.

### Graph
- **Global graph leaf type** with Verlet simulation, SVG render, pan/zoom, click-to-open, live metadata refresh.

### Plugins (built-in)
- Daily Notes, Templates (modal picker), Random Note, Workspaces (named layouts in columns format), File Recovery, Note Composer, Audio Recorder, Unique Note Creator, Web Viewer, Format Converter (wikilinks → markdown, copy as HTML).

### Markdown rules
- **Comments** `%% ... %%` (inline + multi-line block).
- **Wikilinks**, **embeds**, **tags**, **highlights**, **task list items** with `data-line` and `data-checked`.
